# 2019 Challenge Dataset

## Background 

In digital advertising, a “conversion” refers to the event when the shopper clicks on an ad and performs a valuable action such as signup, registration, or make a purchase.  Since a “conversion” is a measurable event, it represents a reasonable proxy for the number of customers acquired during the ad campaign.  Increasingly, brands and agencies are looking to put a value on the Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS), which require marketers such as Valassis to optimize the ad spent such that customer acquisition is maximized.

In order to wisely spend the limited marketing dollars, we need to identify the shoppers who are more likely to respond to our ad and convert.  While the number of devices to target is nearly one billion, the number of conversion events range from just a few hundreds to few thousands during the period of the ad campaign.  In other words, these conversion events are extremely rare.   

## The Challenge 

The primary objective is to predict the shoppers who are likely to convert with very little false alarm. An added impediment is that the information we know about the shopper is incomplete which means the data is sparse.

## The Ask

The dataset is already divided into two groups (refer to Table 1) for your convenience, training and validation.  

1. Use the training data to build a model to predict shoppers who are likely to convert.  
2. Then, use the validation data to evaluate the performance of your model.  
3. Feel free to use any appropriate metric to evaluate the models on the training and validation sets. (You will need to decided on appropriate metrics on your own). 

For various reasons, marketers will have to understand the profile of the shoppers who converted.  
4. What is your take on the profile of the converters?  
5. What other insights can you gain from the data and the model you have built?
